Privacy Policy for [Your App Name]

This Privacy Policy is effective as of October 30, 2025 and governs the privacy practices of FocusDot (the "App"), operated by "We".

We designed this App with your privacy in mind. We aim to keep data collection to an absolute minimum.

1. Information Collection and Use

We generally do not collect, store, or use any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from users of our App.

However, to provide our service, the App may utilize third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

Third-Party Service Providers

The App uses third-party services that may collect data. These providers operate under their own privacy policies. These services include, but are not limited to:

- Google Play Services (for platform functionality)

- Firebase Analytics (for crash reporting and usage analysis)

When you use the App, we may collect Non-Personal Information automatically, such as:

Log Data: Information about your device (e.g., device type, operating system version), the time and date of your use, and crash reporting data.

Device Identifiers: Basic device identifiers used by third-party analytics (like Firebase) to help us understand app usage trends and fix bugs.

2. Permissions Used

The App is designed to function without requesting any special Android Permissions (such as CAMERA, LOCATION, or READ_CONTACTS).

No Sensitive Permissions Requested: The App does not require access to your device's sensitive data or features.

Basic Network Access: The App uses standard, non-requestable network access to communicate with essential third-party services (like Google Play Services and Firebase) for crash reporting and updates. This does not require explicit user consent via the Android permission system.

We only use the necessary underlying functionality to provide the intended experience of the App.

3. Security

We value your trust in providing us with your Non-Personal Information. We strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it, but remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

4. Children's Privacy

These services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Identifiable Information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take the necessary actions.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
